# TikTok Smart Unfollow Bot

**An intelligent, browser-based automation tool for mass unfollowing on TikTok with advanced anti-detection features.**

## üöÄ Repository Name
`tiktok-smart-unfollow-bot`

## üìù Description
A sophisticated JavaScript browser script that automates the process of unfollowing users on TikTok. Built with human-like behavior simulation and advanced evasion techniques to avoid platform detection while maintaining account safety.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß† **Intelligent Anti-Detection System**
- **Random Timing**: Variable delays between 3-7 seconds to mimic human behavior
- **Human Simulation**: Automated mouse movements and varied click patterns
- **Adaptive Pausing**: Smart detection of resistance with automatic slowdown
- **Milestone Breaks**: Scheduled rest periods every 20 unfollows (30-60 seconds)

### ‚ö° **Performance & Safety**
- **Optimized Speed**: 15-20 unfollows per minute (900-1200 per hour)
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Built-in safeguards against TikTok's restrictions
- **Failure Tolerance**: Intelligent handling of missing buttons or page changes
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time counter and console logging

### üéõÔ∏è **User Experience**
- **Visual Control Panel**: Easy-to-use start/stop interface
- **Console Commands**: Power user controls via browser console
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live progress updates and status messages
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from unexpected situations

### üîß **Technical Excellence**
- **Pure JavaScript**: No external dependencies required
- **Cross-Browser**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage
- **Clean Code**: Well-documented and maintainable

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Variable Scrolling**: Randomized scroll amounts (200-600px)
- **Click Hesitation**: Random delays before each action (0.5-1.5s)
- **Consecutive Failure Detection**: Automatic pausing when encountering issues
- **Human-like Patterns**: Non-predictable timing and movement simulation

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Speed | 15-20 unfollows/minute |
| Efficiency | 900-1200 unfollows/hour |
| Detection Risk | Ultra Low |
| Resource Usage | Minimal |
| Browser Support | Universal |

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Navigate** to your TikTok "Following" page
2. **Open** browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
3. **Paste** the script and press Enter
4. **Click** "Start Unfollowing" or run `startUnfollowing()`
5. **Monitor** progress in real-time

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

The script includes several customizable parameters:

```javascript
// Timing Configuration
getRandomDelay() // 3-7 seconds (adjustable)

// Safety Thresholds
consecutiveFailures > 2 // Triggers adaptive delay
totalUnfollowed % 20 === 0 // Milestone break trigger

// Scroll Behavior
scrollAmount = 200-600px // Variable scrolling
```

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Account Cleanup**: Remove inactive or irrelevant follows
- **Privacy Management**: Reduce follower count for privacy
- **Content Curation**: Clean up timeline by unfollowing specific accounts
- **Bot Management**: Remove automated or spam accounts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- **Use Responsibly**: Respect TikTok's terms of service
- **Account Risk**: Automation may violate platform policies
- **No Guarantees**: Users assume all risks of account restrictions
- **Educational Purpose**: Intended for learning automation concepts

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Selective Unfollowing**: Filter by account type or activity
- [ ] **Backup System**: Export following list before processing
- [ ] **Whitelist Support**: Protect specific accounts from unfollowing
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Process followers in smaller, safer chunks
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed statistics and reporting

## üí° Technical Implementation

Built using modern JavaScript with:
- **Event Simulation**: MouseEvent API for realistic interactions
- **DOM Manipulation**: Efficient element selection and interaction
- **Timing Control**: Sophisticated delay and scheduling systems
- **Error Recovery**: Robust exception handling and retry logic
